# Behavior_Tree_on_Unity
This Unity project is a demo of Behavior_Tree_on_Unity. BToU allows you to create your behavior tree on editor window graphically.

Please see "Behavior_Tree_on_Unity/Assets/BehaviorTree/ReadMe.txt" to know how to use it.

# Notice
If you want to use this, I recommend you to use another behavior tree asset from asset store or somewhere.
There might be some bugs and structures that need to be improved in here.
